# genomics-research-paper
This repository includes a detailed description about research paper whose content is talking about sequence alignment and most popular methods or software used. The software tools used here are PASTA and UPP. They are used for DNA(by default), RNA or protein sequence alignment.
I will discuss here briefly how these tools are used as sequence alignment algorithms,their idea, how they work to do Multiple Sequence Alignments(MSA) and finally I will conclude essential topics from this research paper
Finally ,there is a presentation video discussing this paper
